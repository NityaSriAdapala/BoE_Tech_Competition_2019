# Bank of England Technology Competition 2019

This is my entry for the Bank of England Technology Competition 2019, about the impact of climate change on the UK economy. 
Using the large data sets from the excel spreadsheets provided, I created multiple graphs using Python packages such as pandas, matplotlib and scikit. 
After that, I created a video by explaining each graph in detail. 
I take you through a journey from the causes of climate change to the impact climate change has on the UK economy and the different industries within it.
